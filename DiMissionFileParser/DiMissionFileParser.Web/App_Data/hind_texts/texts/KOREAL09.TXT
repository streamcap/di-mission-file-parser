:Situation
Ships and trucks carrying food back to the motherland have been attacked by our malicious enemy. Comrade, your assistance is urgently required to protect these valuable commodities.
:Stalemate
The destruction of relief trucks means that more convoys must travel to the motherland. Comrade, make maximum effort to support the convoys as resources are limited.
:Failure
The vicious enemy has launched a counter-attack in the Incheon area. Comrade, your inadequate air support has lead to additional special forces requiring deployment before the relief operation can continue.
