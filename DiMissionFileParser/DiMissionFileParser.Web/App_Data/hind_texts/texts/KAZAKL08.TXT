:Situation
The co-ordinated attack between the Russian and Kazak forces will take place in a heavily built-up area. Such an attack will be difficult as our armour will have limited room to manoeuvre and the ruthless enemy will have strong defensive positions. Comrade, it is vital to obtain good reconnaissance information on the rebel defences in order to co-ordinate an artillery bombardment and air strikes.
:Stalemate
Comrade, until the allies have a complete picture of the rebel defences the co-ordinated attack cannot proceed. Further flights over the area are required.
:Failure
Your failure to obtain adequate reconnaissance data has forced the brave allies to postpone the co-ordinated attack. The brutal rebels have launched further attacks against the Kazak forces who remain short of supplies and ammunition.
