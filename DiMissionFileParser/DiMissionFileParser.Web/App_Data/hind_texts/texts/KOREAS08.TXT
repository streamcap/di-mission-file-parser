Bitter fighting continues between our glorious forces and the enemy's miserable troops. It is necessary to tip the balance in our favour by destroying a vital bridge over the Han-Gang river. Comrade, eliminate the enemy's vicious air defences and then laser designate the bridge by 03:40 for an attack by our powerful MiG 27's with their devastating laser guided bombs.
:Outstanding
Congratulations Comrade.  The total destruction of this vital bridge has prevented the allies from launching a counter-attack and enabled our magnificent troops to advance further into enemy territory.
:Success
Comrade, the destruction of this vital bridge has stopped the allies from launching a counter-attack.  However, supplies are continuing to get through.
:Failure
Your failure to destroy the bridge has allowed the hated enemy to launch a successful counter-attack. Our brave troops may retrieve the situation if they receive better air support on future missions.
