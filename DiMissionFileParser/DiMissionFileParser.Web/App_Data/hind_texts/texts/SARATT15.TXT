Comrade, it is necessary for you to be able to laser designate targets so that they may be destroyed by our mighty MiG 27's using precision laser-guided bombs.  You are required to fly to waypoint X and designate the target by 15:00 hours.  Listen carefully for the transmitted confirmation of bomb release and maintain laser designation until the bombs have landed.  You may then return to base.
