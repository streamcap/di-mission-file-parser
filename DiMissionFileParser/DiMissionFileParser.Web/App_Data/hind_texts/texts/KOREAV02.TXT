In order to disrupt enemy supplies it is essential to destroy a bridge over the Han-Gang river. Comrade, you are required to eliminate the weak air defences and then laser designate the bridge by 06:30 for an attack by our powerful MiG 27's.
:Outstanding
The total destruction of this strategic bridge is a tremendous achievement for the Hind pilots. Comrade, the enemy's miserable troops are isolated and about to be attacked by our glorious forces.
:Success
Destruction of this choke point has stopped the enemy's supplies from reaching the front-line. Comrade, you have executed your mission well.
:Failure
Failure to destroy this strategic target has allowed the enemy to strengthen their forces and launch a major counter-attack. Comrade, your performance must improve dramatically if our brave troops are to succeed.
