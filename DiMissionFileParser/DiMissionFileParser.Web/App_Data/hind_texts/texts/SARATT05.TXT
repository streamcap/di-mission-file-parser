Comrade, your Hind is armed with 1470 rounds of armour piercing bullets. Comrade, the gun has a high firing rate, so use it sparingly against a range of lightly armed targets. Practise both manual aiming and using the silicon Weapon Systems Operator. Restrict the firing of your weapons to the practice range at waypoint X.
