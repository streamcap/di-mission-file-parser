Considerable enemy activity is evident at a civilian ferry terminal. We suspect that the enemy will launch its counter-attack from this location. Comrade, you are required to suppress any air defences while the rest of your formation attack the jetty.  You must then dispense anti-personnel mines to make the terminal unusable.
