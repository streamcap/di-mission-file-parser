:Description
This announcement is from our glorious leader::
"Flooding and unusually cold weather have badly affected our grain harvest. The imperialist fascist western nations are continuing to plot against our great country by raising the price of grain to beyond our reach. This courageous nation will never bow to such cowardly pressure. So, comrades, take up your arms and fight to secure the food we desperately need to feed our families"

The current border exercises have honed our glorious armed forces to the peak of operational efficiency.  The time has come to advance on our sworn enemy, South Korea. This courageous act is necessary to secure food from storage facilities and distribution centres around the enemy port of Incheon.
:Successful
Congratulations, the campaign has been successfully concluded. With careful rationing we have adequate supplies that will last though to our next harvest. The heroic air support provided throughout the campaign by our great and courageous pilots was a major contribution to the success. Many honours and medals will be awarded by our great and inspirational leader.
:Failure
The campaign has failed due to the loss of air superiority to our spiteful enemy.  Your superiors are blaming this on the poor performance of the Hind pilots. Comrade, you and the other disgraced pilots will be severely reprimanded.
