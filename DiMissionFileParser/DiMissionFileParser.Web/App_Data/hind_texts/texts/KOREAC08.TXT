Several key bridges across the Han-Gang river must be destroyed in order to protect our great army's eastern flank. You, comrade, must clear air defences around your allocated target and laser designate it by 06:00 for the bombing by our powerful Mig-27's. Once the bridge is destroyed, deploy your formidable special forces to secure the area and then proceed to bomb the enemy fortifications on the eastern bank.
