Our aggressive enemy has strengthened troop concentrations near the front-line for a massive counter-attack. Comrade, you must attack these vulnerable troops with your devastating fuel air bombs and then destroy any remaining equipment. Be prepared for considerable enemy air activity.

:Success
Comrade, your effectiveness has relieved the pressure on this sector of the front-line.  Well done.
:Failure
Comrade, your failure has allowed the aggressive enemy forces to launch a major attack in this sector of the front-line. You are in disgrace.
