:Description
It is 1985, over five years after the decisive Russian invasion of Afghanistan. The situation for the Russian and Kabul regimes has deteriorated. Terrorists now control most of the countryside with many major towns and garrisons besieged. The situation is getting progressively worse as the vengeful guerrilla's equipment, tactics and organisation improve. Comrade, our widespread depopulation campaigns have stopped the terrorists from hiding amongst the civilian population, but our frequent air and ground attacks on the guerrilla bases in Pakistan have had little effect. Territory gained in several major offensives has been lost due to manpower requirements and the casualties sustained from the guerrilla's cowardly attacks.

The objective of first Kunar offensive was to open the Jalalabad to Chagha Sarai road and hold it with security outposts. Terrorist supply lines were to be cut, the miserable guerrillas destroyed in the Pech Dara, Asmar and Barikot areas and the besieged garrison at Barikot relieved. Our courageous troops were successful as far as Chagha Sarai with several garrisons in southern Kunar reinforced, but they were then forced to make a tactical retreat to Jalalabad. A second offensive will be launched from Jalalabad on the 23rd May. Comrades, we are depending upon the Hind aircrew to deal effectively with the large numbers of Mujaheddin terrorists.
:Successful
Congratulations on your significant contribution to the success of this brilliant campaign. The garrison at Barikot now has sufficient supplies and reinforcements to last many months. A victory parade will be held, with your squadron leading the flypast. Your superiors are looking forward to decorating the heroes of the motherland.
:Failure
Comrade, the unacceptably high attrition rate of the Hind crews has forced the abandonment of the campaign.  This surprising outcome has raised serious questions about the role of Hind squadrons in future campaigns.
