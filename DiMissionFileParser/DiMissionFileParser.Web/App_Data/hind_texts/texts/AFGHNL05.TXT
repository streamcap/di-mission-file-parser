:Situation
Comrade, the Jalalabad to Chagha Sarai road is secure and it is now necessary to weaken the Mujaheddin by attacking known strongholds and gun emplacements. All villages will be razed to the ground and minefields laid in order to depopulate the area.
:Stalemate
The attacks on the vicious terrorist strongholds have been ineffective. Comrade, further sorties by the Hind helicopters are necessary before the next phase of our brilliant operation can begin.
:Failure
Comrade, your disappointing failure has allowed the aggressive terrorist forces to regroup and launch a vicious counter-attack. Allied troops have made a tactical retreat towards Jalalabad. To complicate matters, the barbaric guerrillas have ambushed this retreating force and attacked several outposts.
