:Situation
Through careful study of allied forces and tactics the North Korean forces have broken through the South Korean defences and are advancing towards the capital. The major priority is to stop the advance so that the allied forces may redeploy and counter the attack. A large number of enemy helicopters and aircraft are supporting the invasion, so be prepared for air-to-air threats.
:Failure
The North Koreans have captured the South's capital city Seoul and are attempting to negotiate a cease-fire through the United Nations. They have issued the statement "Now that the South's capital city and the seat of government is in our control all citizens should consider themselves subjects of a united Korea. Any attempt by the South Korean or American armies to recapture the city will be futile and will meet with strong resistance including the possible use of nuclear weapons." 
This failure has seriously weakened American interests throughout the world and thrown its foreign policies and credibility into disarray. They must now decide whether to counter-attack and risk heavy loss of life in a nuclear incident or back-down and allow aggression to win. A Senate committee has been set up to look into the dismal performance of the armed forces, especially that of the Apache attack helicopters
