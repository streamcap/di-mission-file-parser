The enemy has deployed special forces behind the allied front line in order to direct artillery fire. Shell trajectory radar has given the approximate location of the guns as eight miles from the front line. Locate and destroy as many of the guns as possible. They are believed to be well dug in and camouflaged with AAA and SAM air defenses.
