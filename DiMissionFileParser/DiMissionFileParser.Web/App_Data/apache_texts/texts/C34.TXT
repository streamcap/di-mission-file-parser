:Situation
The allies have given the Turks until 8pm local time today to withdraw their troops from the green line. At dawn the Turks started a major offensive with armoured units crossing into the Greek half of the island. The allies have launched a series of major air strikes in support of the Greek troops. No ground troops have yet been committed beyond the perimeter of the British Sovereign bases.
:Failure
The Greek forces have managed to push the Turks back to the Green line but at great cost in equipment and casualties. They have blamed the lack of allied close air support. Allied command has apologised to the Greek generals for the poor performance of the Apache squadron.
