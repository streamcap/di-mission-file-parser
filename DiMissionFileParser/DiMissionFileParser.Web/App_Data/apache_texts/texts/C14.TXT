:Situation
Squads of special allied forces plan to capture several key points on the highway in order to stop the free movement of government and rebel forces and to allow groups of evacuees to reach the main assembly point. Several locations have been identified, some of which have seen a build-up of enemy armour in the last few hours. The Apaches' role is to assist the special forces by destroying the enemy armour at these locations.
:Failure
Failure to secure the highway has made it impassable to traffic. Workers that escaped from the oil field were cut-off from the assembly area and have retreated to the comparative safety of the camp from where the previous group were evacuated. Another evacuation from the oil field will have to be arranged.
