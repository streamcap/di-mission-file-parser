A large military supply convoy has been detected on the Ta'izz to Al 'Adan road. The enemy were hoping to use the cover of darkness to re-supply and reinforce their forces in the Al 'Adan region. The convoy is protected with strong mobile air defenses consisting of: ZSU-23-4 AAA, SA-6 radar guided and SA-9 infra-red SAM's and several MIL-24 attack helicopters. Deal with any air threats first, then knock out the vehicles in the battle area.
:Outstanding
This has been a very successful operation with major damage inflicted upon the enemy supply network. Enemy forces in the Al 'Adan region are being starved of vital resources. An excellent result.
:Success
Partial destruction of the supply convoy has stopped most supplies getting through. Enemy forces in the Al 'Adan region are suffering the consequences.
:Failure
The poor performance by the Apache helicopters has boosted the enemy's morale and has enabled them to deliver vital supplies to their troops in the Al 'Adan region.
