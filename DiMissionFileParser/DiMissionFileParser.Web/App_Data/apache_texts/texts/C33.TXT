:Situation
Turkish forces are still launching attacks against the Greek defences and the exclusion zone is being ignored. The Turkish authorities have been threatened with air strikes if they fail to pull back from the green line and comply with the total exclusion zone.
:Failure
The failure of the Apache missions has allowed the Turkish forces to mount a successful raid on Dhekelia airbase. UN troops have been captured. The Turks have stated that any attempted attack on the green line will result in the UN troops being used as a human shield.
