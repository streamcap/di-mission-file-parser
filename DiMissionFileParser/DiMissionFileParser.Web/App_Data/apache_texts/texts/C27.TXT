:Situation
The attack on the enemy flanks and encirclement action has been very successful but the entrapment is not complete. The North Koreans have prepared a range of defensive strong points which must be destroyed. They realise the importance of not letting us close the gap and are fighting very hard to keep every inch of ground. A major assault by Apache helicopters is needed to weaken these defensive positions. The North Koreans have committed a large number of helicopters and aircraft to this battle as it will probably decide the outcome of the war so watch out for the air threats.
:Failure
The failure of the Apache force during this major offensive has resulted in allied troops retreating to their initial defensive positions.  A counter-attack is being prepared to put the North Korean flanks under pressure again. The Apache force has been reprimanded over its performance and better things are expected in the future. You must try harder if this operation is to succeed.
