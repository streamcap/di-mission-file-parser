:Situation
The battle is now almost won, with only pockets of Turkish resistance left at various strong points. The largest area still under Turkish control is the Famagusta Bay area near the British airbase Dhekelia. The north coast of the island has been virtually secured by the allied seaborne invasion and Greek attack. The Turks have taken advantage of the limited naval presence to the south of the island by launching a desperate two pronged operation against the Dhekelia airbase. From the north they have launche
d a ground based dawn attack whilst two destroyers have crept inshore to bombard the base. Allied aircraft have been scrambled to intercept low flying Turkish F16's also heading for the area. 
:Failure
The poor efforts of the Apache pilots almost lost Dhekelia. Only by moving forces rapidly to the area at the expense of the main attack was the base saved. This has allowed the almost defeated Turkish army to make large advances in the north, taking back large areas of territory and pushing the allies back towards the original bridgehead. If this battle is going to be won then the Apache crews must dramatically improve their performance.
