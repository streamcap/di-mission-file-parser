:Situation
There are still formidable troop formations within the encirclement which need to be destroyed. The allies now wish to focus on air attacks in order to minimise allied casualties. Although the allies now have the advantage the North Korean army is by no means defeated. There are still significant air defences in the region.
:Failure
The ineffectiveness of the Apache helicopters has undermined the confidence that high command had shown in you. Furthermore, enemy forces have broken through to link up with troops to the rear, re-establishing supply lines and communications. Our troops have been pushed back to create a sizable hole in the encirclement. Blame for this failure can be placed firmly on the Apache pilots' incompetence.
