:Situation
The allies have deployed special forces behind enemy lines for reconnaissance and sabotage purposes. Unfortunately, they have been spotted and are now on the run. A number of allied aircraft have been shot down with their pilots being stranded in enemy territory. Search and rescue helicopters are being sent into the areas where distress beacons have been reported by other allied aircraft.
:Failure
The allies have postponed a major diversionary attack because the capture of the special forces and aircrew has ruined the element of surprise. The allies have again set a deadline for Turkish Troops to withdraw from the Green line, hoping that the recent Turkish set backs will make them change their minds.
