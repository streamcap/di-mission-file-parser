:Situation
The government and rebel forces have recovered from the initial shock of the Marine task force and they are both trying to stop the evacuation by controlling the Sana - Ta'izz - Al 'Adan highway. The fighting amongst Yemen forces and rebels seems to have died down and their new common objective is to stop this operation. If they gain control of the highway they will be able to call upon reinforcements that will make holding the assembly area very difficult.
:Failure
Your failure to keep the main highway to the airport open has not only stopped the evacuees from reaching the airport, but they have also suffered casualties. The Yemen forces are now using the highway to bring in further reinforcements for attacking Al 'Adan airport.
