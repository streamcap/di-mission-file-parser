:Situation
The allies have lost patience with the Turks and launched a surprise ship-borne invasion on the north coast of the island east of Kyrenia. At the same time Greek troops have launched a major counter attack on the Green Line. The aim is to remove the Turks from the island and unite Cyprus as an independent country.
:Failure
The allied invasion has been withdrawn due to an unacceptably high casualty rate. This can be laid squarely at the door of the ineffective attacks by the Apache helicopters. Several pilots have been lost in enemy territory and some special forces are also stranded and need rescuing.
