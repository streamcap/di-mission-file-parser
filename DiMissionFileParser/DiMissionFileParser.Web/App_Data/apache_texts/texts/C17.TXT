:Situation
The Yemen navy has launched an attack against the ships of the task force by deploying its missile gun boats and laying mines. If the gunboats can get into range and fire there missiles simultaneously they overwhelm the task force's defences. Mines represent a major threat as the task force does not contain a mine sweeper.
:Failure
The retreat by the task force has enabled the government and rebel forces to re-group. They have repaired damage, establish new lines of supply, and positioned more tanks near the assembly area. The evacuation has been postponed until these new threats have been eliminated.
