There have been several violations of the exclusion zone by Turkish helicopters based at Salamis. As this is only a short distance from the Apache airbase surprise attacks are a major concern. A pre-emptive strike is planned with the Apaches concentrating on the ground targets while F14's and F18's engage enemy fighters.
