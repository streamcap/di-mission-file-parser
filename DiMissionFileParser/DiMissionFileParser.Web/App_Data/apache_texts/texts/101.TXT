The enemy has constructed extensive fortified defenses. The allies intend to breach these defenses in three phases. Apaches will spearhead the attack by destroying as many of the tanks and artillery pieces as possible. Secondly, MLRS will be used for mine and area clearance. Finally, engineering vehicles will breach the fortification. As this is a coordinated attack make sure you are on time. Amongst the fortifications are extensive air defenses so expect to come under heavy fire.
