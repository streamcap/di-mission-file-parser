:Situation
The allies still have strong troop and equipment concentrations near the border. These are going to be used to attack the enemy flanks in an attempt to surround and cut them off. The North Korean flanks are very strongly defended so this will be a major offensive which will require full support from the Apache helicopters. The success of this attack will signal the beginning of the end for the North Korean attack.
:Failure
The failure of this flank attack has been a major disappointment to the allies. It has lost the opportunity of a decisive victory over the enemy. It has also given the enemy time to establish a new headquarters and battlefield communications site.
