Al 'Adan airfield has been attacked with SCUD missiles. Four launchers have been identified in reconnaissance photographs and are still believed to be in the area. There are a number of SAM and AAA air defense sites nearby so stay low as you hunt and destroy as many of the launchers as possible.
:Outstanding
The search and destroy mission has been very successful with no more SCUD missile attacks in the area. Congratulations.
:Success
The mission has succeeded in reducing the number of SCUD missile attacks at the airfield. 
:Failure
SCUD missiles are still hitting the allied positions regularly and causing casualties. High command were expecting much better results than this from their Apache crews.
