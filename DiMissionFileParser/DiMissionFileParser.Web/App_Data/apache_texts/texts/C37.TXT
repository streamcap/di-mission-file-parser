:Situation
The allies have now established a bridgehead and are advancing to link up with the Greek forces. The Turkish half of the island will then be divided into two. The main task for the Apaches is to support the advancing forces and keep lines of supply free from enemy attack. 
:Failure
The poor support from the Apaches has enabled the Turks to push the invasion bridgehead almost back to the sea and they are closing in on the airborne troops sent ahead to secure strategic points. An all out effort is now going to be needed to reverse the situation.
