:Situation
At present, the primary duty for the Apache squadron is the defence of British Sovereign bases. Any air or land-based threat should be responded to immediately and repelled with the minimum of force. An agreement has been made with the Greek government to respond to any attack on their forces defending the island. The allies are planning a series of missions to accelerate Turkish compliance with the UN resolutions.
:Failure
The failure of the allied response has led to a full Turkish invasion of the Greek half of the island which collapsed in a matter of hours. The Turkish government has respected the sovereignty of British bases by not occupying them. However, all United Nations troops are to leave immediately. Due to the poor operational standard of the Apache pilots the allies have no alternative but pursue the matter further through the United Nations.
