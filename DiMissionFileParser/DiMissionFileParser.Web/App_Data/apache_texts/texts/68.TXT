Combat operations will require you to take-off from and land on a moving ship.  Unfortunately we cannot provide you with an aircraft carrier at Fort Hood so we suggest that you practice landing at a precise location with crosswinds. You are not cleared to fire any weapons on this flight.  Do not approach any target areas.
