:Situation 
After careful consideration the airport just outside Al 'Adan (Aden) has been chosen as the main assembly area for the evacuation. The area seems to be lightly defended and the Marines should have no problems securing it. Apaches are being held in reserve in case unexpected resistance is met. A large number of foreign nationals are in Yemen's capital Sana but logistically it is impossible to set up an assembly area nearby. The main highway between Sana and Al 'Adan must be kept open to enable the evacuees 
to reach the assembly area.
:Failure
The Apaches' failure to take-out the armoured forces surrounding Al 'Adan airport has lead to the withdrawal of the Marine forces. This is a humiliating failure for the Western nations. The Western expatriates will have to fend for themselves. Major casualties are expected. Congress is asking why are our forces are incapable of performing such a simple operation. Heads will roll including yours!
