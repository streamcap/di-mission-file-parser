:Situation
The Turks have ignored the UN response and are continuing to hold the United Nations troops as hostages. The allies have decided to mount a rescue operation. The Turks have started probing attacks along the border to test the strength of the Greek defence.
:Failure
The attempt to rescue the United Nations troops failed due to the poor performance of the Apache pilots. Having lost the element of surprise, further rescue attempts are not possible for the time being. The allies remain on high alert and are expecting more probing raids against the British Sovereign bases. The allies are planning to increase the counter offensive.
