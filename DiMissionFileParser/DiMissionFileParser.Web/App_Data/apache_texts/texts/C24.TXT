:Situation
The North Korean attack has stalled and the supply structure is in disarray. They are now threatening to use the tactical nuclear weapons they have developed unless the American and South Korean Governments agree to an immediate cease-fire. Fortunately, American intelligence has located the deep underground bunker where they are stored. The plan is to precision bomb the bunker's entrance. The Apache helicopters have been tasked with disrupting the air-defence and ECM networks as part of the attack.
:Failure
The attack on the nuclear bunker has been postponed due to the failure of the Apache mission. The allies have scaled down their pressure on the North Korean attack to try and defuse the threat of a tactical nuclear strike. The North Koreans are using this window of opportunity to reinforce and re-supply their troops.
