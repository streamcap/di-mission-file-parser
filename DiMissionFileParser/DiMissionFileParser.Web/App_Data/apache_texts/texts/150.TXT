An enemy task force of several Osa II gunboats has attacked allied ships in Inch'on harbour. Enemy helicopters have been identified on our radar flying towards the task force. You have no time to lose. You are expected to dispose of the incoming threat and then destroy the task force.
:Outstanding
Justice has been done with the total destruction of the enemy task force and the accompanying Hind helicopters. The whole nation is rejoicing at the success of the Apache crews.
:Success
The successful attack on the enemy's task force is a credit to your squadron. This major achievement has been reported to the nation.
:Failure
Your failure to dispose of the enemy gunboats is deplorable. Such incompetence will not be tolerated. You will attend an intensive course of training.
