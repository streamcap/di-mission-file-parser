In order to disrupt enemy supplies it is essential to destroy a bridge over the Kesong-Gang river. You are required to eliminate the air defences and then laser designate the bridge by 06:30 for an attack by F16's using laser guided bombs.
:Outstanding
The total destruction of this strategic bridge is a tremendous victory for the Apache pilots. The enemy's troops are now isolated and about to be attacked by our ground forces.
:Success
Destruction of this choke point has stopped the enemy's supplies from reaching the front-line. You have executed your mission well.
:Failure
Failure to destroy this strategic target has allowed the enemy to strengthen their forces and launch a major counter-attack. Your performance must improve dramatically if our troops are to succeed.
